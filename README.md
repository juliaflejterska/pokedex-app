POKEDEX APP is a React application that was created for the recruitment task. It is an interactive catalogue of pokemon with data fetched from ‘Pokémon API’ (https://pokeapi.com).

---

✨ Initially, a list of 20 pokemon is displayed on the screen. Of course you can load more of them - there is a special button for that.

✨ When you hover your mouse over one of the cards, you can see basic information about the selected creature: its name and type. When you click on it, its weight and height also appear.

✨ Moreover, POKEDEX APP allows you to sort the displayed pokemon by their type. You can also search for any pokemon that is available in ‘Pokémon API’ by entering its name in the special field provided for this.

✨ By clicking on the moon icon, you can change the mode from light to dark and vice versa.

The animations and transitions used are from the Framer Motion library.
